First Way of including React in the project:

Get the CDN link & put links into the project
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

What is CDN ?

What is crossorigin argument in script tag?


ReactElement is nothing but it's a object. This object convert into HTML which browser understands.
